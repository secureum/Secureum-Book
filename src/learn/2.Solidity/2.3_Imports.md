# Imports

These `import` statements are similar to `Javascript`, where the format is

```solidity
import <filename>;
```

They help to modularize your code: split what might become a large monolithic code base into multiple components (modules) and import them wherever they are required.

This helps developers to reuse code and, again, not only it affects the readability of code (compare a piece of monolithic code that is hundreds or thousands of lines versus modular code, where they're separated out into independent self-contained modules and used only when required), it also has implications to security and optimization as well.
