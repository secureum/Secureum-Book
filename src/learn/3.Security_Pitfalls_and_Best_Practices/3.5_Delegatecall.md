# `delegatecall`

The security pitfall is related to the use of `delegatecall` in contracts where the `delegatecall` may be made to an address that is user controlled. Remember that in the case of `delegatecall`s, the calling contract makes a `delegatecall` to a called contract, where the called contract executes its logic on the state of the calling contract.

So, if the address of the called contract is user controlled, then the user may accidentally or maliciously make this `delegatecall` to a malicious contract, that can make unauthorized modifications to the state of the calling contract.

Therefore, `delegatecall`s should be used with extreme care in contracts. All precautions should be used to ensure that the destination addresses for such `delegatecall`s are trusted.
