# Private Data

This security pitfall is related to the notion of what is private data on a blockchain or the privacy of on-chain data. 

Remember that state variables and `Solidity` have a function visibility specifier. By making this specified a `private`, such private state variables can't be read only by other smart contracts on the blockchain, this does not mean that they can't be read at all.

We don't have to believe that they are considered private in a confidentiality perspective because the state of such variables and contracts and transactions in general on the blockchain can be read by anyone on the chain itself or via off-chain interfaces by querying the mempools for transactions or by querying the contract state itself to look at what values such private variables contain.

This effectively means that, **there is no notion of data being private on the blockchain** and any such data for confidentiality reasons that needs to be private should be encrypted and stored off-chain.
