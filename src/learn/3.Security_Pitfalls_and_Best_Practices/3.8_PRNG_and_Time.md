# PRNG and Time

## PRNG

This security pitfall is related to pseudo-random number generation on the blockchain within smart contracts applications that require such random numbers. 

Remember that these values could be influenced to a certain extent by miners who are mining the blocks that contain these values. So if the stakes in those applications using these as sources of randomness is high, then such actors could use their influence to a certain extent to gain advantage.

So this is a risk from randomness that needs to be paid attention to something to be aware of and, if the stakes are high for the applications where you desire a much better source of randomness then, there are some alternatives such as the verifiable random function provided by Chainlink.

## Time

Similar to randomness, the notion of getting the time on-chain is also tricky. Often smart contracts resort to using `block.timestamp` or `block.number` as sources for inferring the time within the application's logic. 

Again, what needs to be paid attention to is that this notion of time can be influenced to a certain extent by the miners. There are issues with synchronization across the different blockchain nodes and there are also aspects of the block times that change by a certain degree over time.

This is again a risk that needs to be paid attention to and, there are some alternatives to this using the concept of Oracles.
