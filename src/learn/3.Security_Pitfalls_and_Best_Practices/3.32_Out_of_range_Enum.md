# Out-of-range Enum

Older versions of `Solidity` produced unexpected behavior with out-of-range enums. For example we had `enum E{a}` (with a single member `a`) as shown here, then `E(1)` is out-of-range because, remember, indexing of `enum` members begins with 0.

So `E(1)` here is out-of-range because there's a single mapper. This out-of-range `enum` produced unexpected behavior in `Solidity < 0.4.5`. This was due to a compiler bug which has since been fixed.

The best practice until the fix was applied was to check the use of `enums` to make sure they are not out-of-range.
