# Contract Creation

We mentioned that a transaction can result in contract creation.

The creation transaction is a special one because it's sent to a special destination address called "_the zero address_" (`0x0` address), which is an address that has zero in all its bits. This zero address is treated in a special maner within Ethereum, and it becomes critical to some of the smart contract security properties.

It contains a data payload which represents the byte code of the contract that is being created, and it may also contain an optional Ether amount in the value field, in which case the new contract that is being created, will have a starting balance equal to this Ether value.
