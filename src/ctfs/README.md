# Secureum A-MAZE-X CTFs

A-MAZE-X are a series of CTFs that are designed to help participants learn about smart contract security and the Ethereum ecosystem. 

These CTFs consisted of a series of smart contracts written where the participants had to find vulnerabilities in the contracts and exploit them to get the flag. The participants were given some background information regarding common smart contract vulnerabilities and a set of hints to help them complete the challenges.

For now, there exist 3 A-MAZE-X Workshops:
1. [Secureum A-MAZE-X]() held as part of the [Activate X Wormhole Hackathon](https://www.activate.build/miami) held at [Miami Dade College](https://www.mdc.edu/), Florida, USA on 18-22 May 2021.
