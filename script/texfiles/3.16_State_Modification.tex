\section{State Modification}\label{state-modification}

Contract state modifications made in functions whose mutability is
declared as \texttt{view} or \texttt{pure} will revert in contracts
compiled with \texttt{Solidity} version greater than or equal to
\texttt{0.5.0}.

This is because this compiler version started using the
\texttt{STATICCALL} opcode for such functions, this instruction leads to
a revert, if that particular function modifies the contract state.

So when analyzing the security aspects of contracts it's good to pay
attention to the mutability of the functions to see, if they are
\texttt{view} or \texttt{pure}, but they actually modify the contract
state in which case they would lead to reverts at runtime.
