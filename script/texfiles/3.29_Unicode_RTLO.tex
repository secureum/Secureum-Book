\section{Unicode RTLO}\label{unicode-rtlo}

There is a security pitfall that arises because of the use of the
Unicode Right-to-Left-Override control character (\texttt{U+202E}) in
\texttt{Solidity} smart contracts causes the text to be rendered from
right to left instead of the usual left to right.

This reverse rendering confuses the users as well as the security
reviewers from understanding what the real intent is of that particular
snippet of the smart contract.

The best practice here is to ensure that such confusing Unicode
characters (the RTLO control character) is not used within smart
contracts at all.
