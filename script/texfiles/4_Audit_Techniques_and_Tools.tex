\chapter{Audit Techniques \& Tools}\label{audit-techniques-tools}

In this chapter we will cover the various technical and non-technical
aspects of smart contact auditing, starting with the high level view of
what are audits (the entire context around it). Then we'll review the
widely used tools in this space developed by teams from Trail of Bits,
Consensus Diligence and others. We will cover high level aspects of
these tools without getting too much into their operational or technical
details which is out of scope.If you want to learn more about these
tools, it is highly encouraged to install them and experiment with them.

Finally we will review the audit process and the various aspects that
one will need to understand to become a smart contact security auditor.
