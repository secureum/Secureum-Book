\section{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{delegatecall}}{delegatecall}}\label{delegatecall}

The security pitfall is related to the use of \texttt{delegatecall} in
contracts where the \texttt{delegatecall} may be made to an address that
is user controlled. Remember that in the case of \texttt{delegatecall}s,
the calling contract makes a \texttt{delegatecall} to a called contract,
where the called contract executes its logic on the state of the calling
contract.

So, if the address of the called contract is user controlled, then the
user may accidentally or maliciously make this \texttt{delegatecall} to
a malicious contract, that can make unauthorized modifications to the
state of the calling contract.

Therefore, \texttt{delegatecall}s should be used with extreme care in
contracts. All precautions should be used to ensure that the destination
addresses for such \texttt{delegatecall}s are trusted.
