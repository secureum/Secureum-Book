\section{Keywords}\label{keywords}

This security best practice is related to the use of duplicated keywords
in \texttt{Solidity} over the different compiler versions.

Different keywords have been deprecated to favor one over the other, so
for example \texttt{msg.gas} has been deprecated to favor
\texttt{msg.gasLeft}, \texttt{throw} has been deprecated to favor the
use of \texttt{revert}, \texttt{sha3} for \texttt{keccak-256},
\texttt{callcode} for \texttt{delegatecall}, \texttt{constant} Keyword
for \texttt{view}, the \texttt{var} Keyword for using the actual type
name instead.

So all such deprecated keywords they start initially as compiler
warnings where the compiler wants us not to use these keywords and over
the future versions these warnings could be converted into compiler
errors in which case the compilation fails.

So the best practice here is to simply avoid the use of deprecated
keywords even if they are compiling warnings, because these warnings can
become errors in the future compiler versions.
