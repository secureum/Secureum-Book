\section{Out-of-range Enum}\label{out-of-range-enum}

Older versions of \texttt{Solidity} produced unexpected behavior with
out-of-range enums. For example we had \texttt{enum\ E\{a\}} (with a
single member \texttt{a}) as shown here, then \texttt{E(1)} is
out-of-range because, remember, indexing of \texttt{enum} members begins
with 0.

So \texttt{E(1)} here is out-of-range because there's a single mapper.
This out-of-range \texttt{enum} produced unexpected behavior in
\texttt{Solidity\ \textless{}\ 0.4.5}. This was due to a compiler bug
which has since been fixed.

The best practice until the fix was applied was to check the use of
\texttt{enums} to make sure they are not out-of-range.
