\section{Reference Parameters}\label{reference-parameters}

Remember that \texttt{Solidity} has value types and reference types.
This security pitfall is related to the use of reference types in
function parameters when structs, arrays or mappings, which are the
reference types, are passed as arguments to a function.

They may be passed by value or they may be passed by reference. This
difference is dictated by the use of either the \texttt{memory} or the
\texttt{storage} keyword that specifies their data location. This was
optional before \texttt{Solidity} version \texttt{0.5.0}, but since that
version it is required to be specified explicitly.

This difference is critical from a security perspective, because passing
by value, if you remember, makes a copy, so any changes to the copy does
not affect the original value. But passing by reference, creates a
pointer to the original variable, so any changes to the passed value is
actually modifying the original variable itself.

This, if not treated properly could lead to unexpected changes and
modifications of the original variable or a copy which could have very
different behavior and impact for the smart contract logic.
