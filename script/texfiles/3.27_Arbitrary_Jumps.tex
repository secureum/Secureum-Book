\section{Arbitrary Jumps}\label{arbitrary-jumps}

Arbitrary jumps are possible within \texttt{Solidity}. \texttt{Solidity}
supports many different types, one of which is a function type. These
function type variables are not frequently encountered, but if they are,
they can are mainly found within assembly code in making arbitrary
manipulations to variables of these types. In that case, they could be
used to change the control flow to switch to an arbitrary location in
the code. This is something to be paid attention to and from a
development perspective something to be avoided.

Assembly in general is very tricky to use and it bypasses many security
aspects of \texttt{Solidity} such as type safety, so it's best to avoid
the use of assembly if possible and definitely to avoid the use of
function type variables and making arbitrary changes to it. This is
because that could result in changes to control flow that is unexpected
by the developers or the smart contract auditors.
