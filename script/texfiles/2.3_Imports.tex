\section{Imports}\label{imports}

These \texttt{import} statements are similar to \texttt{Javascript},
where the format is

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Solidity,numbers=none]
import <filename>;
\end{lstlisting}

They help to modularize your code: split what might become a large
monolithic code base into multiple components (modules) and import them
wherever they are required.

This helps developers to reuse code and, again, not only it affects the
readability of code (compare a piece of monolithic code that is hundreds
or thousands of lines versus modular code, where they're separated out
into independent self-contained modules and used only when required), it
also has implications to security and optimization as well.
