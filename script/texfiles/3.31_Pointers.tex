\subsection{Storage Pointers}\label{storage-pointers}

There is a security pitfall related to the use of uninitialized storage
pointers. Local storage variables that are uninitialized can point to
unexpected storage locations within the contract.

This can lead to developers unintentionally modifying the contract
state, which can lead to serious vulnerabilities. Given that this is so
error-prone, \texttt{Solidity} compiler \texttt{0.5.0} started
disallowing such pointers.

\subsection{Function Pointers}\label{function-pointers}

There was a security risk in using uninitialized function pointers
within constructors of contracts because of a compiler bug that resulted
in unexpected behavior.

This compiler bug was present in \texttt{Solidity} versions
\texttt{0.4.5} to \texttt{0.4.26} and \texttt{0.5.0} to \texttt{0.5.7}
and has since been fixed.
