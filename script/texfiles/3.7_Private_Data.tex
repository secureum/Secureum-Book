\section{Private Data}\label{private-data}

This security pitfall is related to the notion of what is private data
on a blockchain or the privacy of on-chain data.

Remember that state variables and \texttt{Solidity} have a function
visibility specifier. By making this specified a \texttt{private}, such
private state variables can't be read only by other smart contracts on
the blockchain, this does not mean that they can't be read at all.

We don't have to believe that they are considered private in a
confidentiality perspective because the state of such variables and
contracts and transactions in general on the blockchain can be read by
anyone on the chain itself or via off-chain interfaces by querying the
mempools for transactions or by querying the contract state itself to
look at what values such private variables contain.

This effectively means that, \textbf{there is no notion of data being
private on the blockchain} and any such data for confidentiality reasons
that needs to be private should be encrypted and stored off-chain.
