\chapter{Audit Findings}\label{audit-findings}

In this chapter, we will review findings from public audit reports of
leading audit firms to get a sense for the kinds of issues reported
during audits and their suggestive fixes or recommendations. The
severity of these findings spans a wide spectrum (they may go from
medium severity to high and critical, which are of the highest concern
as they could have led to loss of funds or significantly affected
execution, if they had not been detected and fixed during audits; or
also be low severity, informational and best practice guidelines).

We will only be able to touch upon key aspects of these findings. The
reason is that these findings require a lot of context from the deepest
details of the protocol implementations, which is certainly out of
scope. This research will need to be done by interested bootcamp
participants in their own time, by reviewing the audit reports and their
corresponding protocol codebases to whatever depth possible.

For each finding, we will review the vulnerability category, its finding
summary and the proposed recommendation while relating some of these
aspects to our learnings from the earlier chapters.
