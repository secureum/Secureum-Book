\section{ABI Encoding/Decoding}\label{abi-encodingdecoding}

\texttt{Solidity} supports multiple functions in these categories. The
obvious ones are the \texttt{abi.encode()} and \texttt{abi.decode()}
functions that take arguments and encode them or decode them,
specifically with respect to the ABI.

There are also functions that encode with the function selector
(\texttt{abi.encodeWithSelector()}) or with the signature
(\texttt{abi.encodeWithSignature()}), and finally there is
\texttt{abi.encodePacked()} which takes the arguments and performs the
encoding in a packed fashion ( there's no padding applied between the
arguments supplied).

For this reason the packed encoding can be ambiguous. This is something
that affects security when you're considering these functions,
specifically this \texttt{abi.encodePacked()} function.
